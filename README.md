**#New Factoring Branch, Consider Mr. Abir Notes**

# SprializeMatrix_TDD

#Inside this repo, I have posted two version of SprializeMatrix Project, the first one Before refactor and the second one after doing refactoring

#I have followed TDD framework [Red, Green, Refactror] for test the solution


****# in this Branch, I have refactor solution to consider the below changes****

1- Moving the checkSize of Array to Matrix object, and add new unit test to check if the matrix allowd only greater than or equal 5.

2- Variable Names consistencies and following Camel Case in all Variables name.

3- Remove all empty Lines, Comments.

4- Remove all Brackets for if else and for loops with only one statement.

5- Use Matrix constructor to initiate the Matrix and set the object fields.

5- replace int[,] ListElements = matrix.SetInitialValues(matrixSize) with field inside Matrix object
